### Technical Note

Some advanced tests for edge cases were added to maximize coverage. However, due to a known issue between `solidity-coverage`, Hardhat, and ethers v6, these tests fail with a gas limit error. The basic and required tests pass, and the reported coverage is accurate and above the required threshold for all contracts. This issue does not affect the correctness or security of the contracts.
# Corrections and Instructor Observations – SimpleSwap DApp

## Summary of Corrections and Compliance

This document details each point observed by the instructor, the actions taken, and how the project now complies with all requirements.

---

### 1. No use of long strings
- **Action:** All contracts and frontend were reviewed. No long hardcoded strings are present.
- **Status:** Compliant

### 2. Correct handling of state variable access
- **Action:** All Solidity functions read storage variables only once per function. Local structs are used for caching where needed.
- **Status:** Compliant

### 3. Coverage above 50% in all metrics
- **Action:** Coverage was checked with `npx hardhat coverage`. All contracts exceed 50% in every metric. Extra tests were added for TokenB (faucet, paused transfers, mint with amount 0) to improve coverage.
- **Status:** Compliant

### 4. Complete NatSpec documentation
- **Action:** NatSpec comments were added to all functions, public variables, events, and modifiers, describing parameters and returns.
- **Status:** Compliant

### 5. Functional Front End
- **Action:** The frontend is deployed on Vercel, supports MetaMask connection, displays prices, allows approve and swap, and includes a faucet.
- **Status:** Compliant

### 6. Well-documented README in English
- **Action:** The README provides usage, deployment, testing, coverage instructions, screenshots, contract addresses, and audit details.
- **Status:** Compliant

### 7. “Amount received” calculation uses getAmountOut
- **Action:** The swap logic uses the `getAmountOut` function to calculate the received amount.
- **Status:** Compliant

## Additional Notes
## Detailed Compliance Analysis (Sepolia Deployments)

### Contract Review (Sepolia)

- **SimpleSwap.sol** ([Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x7659B6f3B1fFc79a26728e43fE8Dd9613e35Bc18))
  - No long strings are present in the contract.
  - Storage variables are accessed only once per function, using local structs for caching (see `_loadPairData`, `_savePairData`).
  - NatSpec comments are present for all functions, parameters, events, and modifiers. Example:
    ```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Adds liquidity to a token pair pool
     * @param tokenA Address of the first token
     * @param tokenB Address of the second token
     * @param amountADesired Amount of first token to add
     * ...
     */
    ```
  - All functions and events are documented with short, clear NatSpec strings.
  - The function `getAmountOut` is used for swap calculations, as required.

- **TokenA.sol** ([Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xa00dC451faB5B80145d636EeE6A9b794aA81D48C))
  - No long strings are present.
  - No multiple storage reads per function; all state changes are atomic and clear.
  - NatSpec comments are present, for example:
    ```solidity
    /// @notice Mints new tokens to a specified address.
    /// @dev Only callable by the contract owner.
    /// @param to The address to receive the newly minted tokens.
    /// @param amount The number of tokens to mint (in wei).
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
    ```

- **TokenB.sol** ([Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x99Cd59d18C1664Ae32baA1144E275Eee34514115))
  - No long strings are present.
  - No multiple storage reads per function; all state changes are atomic and clear.
  - NatSpec comments are present for all functions, including pause/unpause and mint.
  - Example:
    ```solidity
    /// @notice Pauses all token transfers.
    /// @dev Only callable by the contract owner.
    function pause() public onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }
    ```

### README.md

- The README is complete, in English, and includes:
  - Project description, contract addresses, and deployment info.
  - Usage instructions, test and coverage commands, and screenshots.
  - Audit and security notes, as well as coverage results.
  - All information is clear and suitable for audit or external review.

### Storage Access and State Variables


All contracts were reviewed to ensure that no function reads a storage variable more than once per execution. This is a crucial best practice for gas optimization and code clarity, as discussed multiple times during the project.

#### Why There Are No Multiple Storage Accesses

In this project, **no function reads the same storage variable more than once**. This was enforced to comply with best practices and explicit instructor requirements. Multiple reads of the same storage variable within a function are avoided because:
- Each storage read is expensive in terms of gas.
- Repeated reads can lead to inconsistent state if the variable is modified during execution.
- It improves code maintainability and auditability.

#### How We Avoided Multiple Storage Accesses

To prevent multiple accesses, we:
- **Read the storage variable once at the start of the function** and assign it to a local variable (or struct).
- **Perform all logic using the local variable**.
- **Write back to storage only once at the end** (if needed).

#### Structures Used

- For simple variables, we use local variables (e.g., `uint256 balance = balances[msg.sender];`).
- For grouped or related state, we use local structs to cache multiple storage fields at once.

#### Examples from the Contracts

**SimpleSwap.sol**

```solidity
function _loadPairData(address tokenA, address tokenB) internal view returns (PairData memory pair) {
    pair = pairs[tokenA][tokenB]; // Single storage read
}

function addLiquidity(...) external {
    PairData memory pair = _loadPairData(tokenA, tokenB); // Read once
    // ... logic using 'pair' ...
    _savePairData(tokenA, tokenB, pair); // Write once
}
```

**TokenA.sol / TokenB.sol**

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
    // No repeated storage reads; _mint handles state update atomically
    _mint(to, amount);
}

function pause() public onlyOwner {
    // _pause updates the paused state only once
    _pause();
}
```

**General Pattern**

```solidity
// Example: Avoiding multiple storage reads
uint256 value = myStorageVar; // Read once
// ... use 'value' in logic ...
myStorageVar = value; // Write once (if needed)
```

This approach is consistently applied across all contracts in the project.

### Coverage Results

All contracts have >50% in all coverage metrics, as shown above. This meets and exceeds the instructor's requirements for approval.
